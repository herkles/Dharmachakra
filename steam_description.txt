Dharmachakra is as the title indicates a mod dedicated to India and the neighboring Regions like Tibet and Burma, as well as the Dharmic Religions of Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism and the religions that have been influenced by them.

I welcome any and all feedback - I am still getting the hang of CK3 modding atm. So please let me know if you encounter any bugs, find things imbalanced, if you have any suggestions, or anything else about the mod. I hope to add more decisions, events, and mechanics with future updates to the mod.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.
