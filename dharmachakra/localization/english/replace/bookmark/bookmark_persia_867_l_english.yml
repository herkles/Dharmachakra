 bm_867_persia: "The Iranian Intermezzo"
 bm_867_persia_desc: "Two hundred years have passed since the Rashidun Caliphate conquered Persia, absorbing the vast plateau into the mighty Arabic Empire.\n\nTwo hundred years of servitude — yet all things turn in time.\n\nNow the Lords of Arabia wane, whilst Persia's ancient nobility wax stronger and fuller than they have in centuries, flourishing amidst the shattering of the once-almighty united Islamic Ummah.\n\nTo the west, the Abbasid Caliphate controls only the heartlands of the former Rashidun empire, their great governors from Iberia to India independent in all but name, the succession embroiled in an anarchic mess of betrayal, murder, and rebellion.\n\nTo the east, Islamic adventurers and sell-swords cut off by the Hindu Kush eye the spoils of Rajasthan and Kannauj greedily.\n\nPersia finds itself at a crossroads. Those loyal to the Caliph clash with the remaining followers of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism, ambitious warlords squabble with mountain chieftains, and Turkic mercenaries spar with Arabic invaders.\n\n#Bold The world turns: where will it take #Italic you?#!"
