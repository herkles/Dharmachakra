  bm_867_sea_india_desc:0 "Since the end of the Varman dynasty in 770 CE, the rich lands of Kannauj, or Kanyakubja, have been a hotly contested prize among the kingdoms of India. Though control of the city passed in turn between the Pratihara, Pala, and Rashtrakuta dynasties, ultimately Nahabhata Pratihara succeeded in fending off the others, making Kanyakubja the crown jewel of the Pratihara state.\n\n#bold But while the battle has ended, the kingdoms of Pala and Rashtrakuta still stand, and the tide may yet turn. Any one of these rulers could retake Kanyakubja, and from there become master of all land lying between the two seas. Which will you be?#!"

  bookmark_sea_india_pratihara_desc:0 "Nearly a century ago, Vatsaraja Pratihara vowed to become "master of all the land lying between the two seas." Today, his great-grandson, Mihira Bhoja, holds control of much of northern India, between the Palas to the east, Rashtrakutas to the south, and Muslim invaders to the west. The great city of Kanyakubja lies, for the moment, in Pratihara hands, defended by the mightiest army on the subcontinent.\n\n#bold The Pratihara dynasty stands tall, but not unchallenged. Though the strongest force in India at the moment, they also face the greatest number of obstacles. Will you fulfill Vatsaraja's dreams of conquest, or will your enemies overwhelm the Western Quarter? #!"

  bookmark_sea_india_rashtrakuta_desc:0 "Wise, benevolent, and kind, Amoghavarsha I is known as one of India's greatest rulers since Ashoka himself. His reign, largely a peaceful one managed with strategic marriage alliances, saw the flourishing of arts and scholarship and the construction of great temples.\n\nAmoghavarsha Rashtrakuta's reign will be well-remembered for all time. But after over fifty years, he grows old, and the realm will soon be left to other, potentially less capable hands.\n\n#bold Will Amoghavarsha's great peace endure, or will his passing mark the beginning of the end for Rashtrakuta? #!"

  bookmark_sea_india_pala_desc:0 "After suffering defeats at the hands of both the Pratihara and Rashtrakuta empires, the Palas are in decline. Narayanapala's reign was simply one in a succession of weak rulers struggling to hold the realm together.\n\n#bold Though now weak, a skillful ruler may still be able to return the realm to its past and future greatness. Will you bring Bengal, and perhaps even all of India, under your rule? Or is the time of the Palas at an end? #!"

  bm_867_sea_tibet_desc:0 "The Tibetan Empire has fallen into chaos. Tsenpo Langdarma was assassinated in 842, splitting the plateau between his two sons, Ösung and Yumten. While the fate of the realm hangs in the balance, other kingdoms see opportunity.\n\n#bold Is Tibet shattered once and for all? Or will it be reunited under a new emperor? #!"

  bookmark_sea_tibet_khotan_desc:0 "The Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan has existed for centuries, but fell under Tibetan rule in 670. With the empire in disarray, Khotan is free once more. Situated in the Tarim Basin, it occupies a crucial stretch of the Silk Road between the nomadic tribes of the north, Tibet and India to the south, and the Islamic emirates in the west.\n\n#bold Will you help Shah Vijaya Vikarma II lead his people through a new era of independence and prosperity, or will the kingdom fall to ruin? #!"

  bookmark_sea_tibet_qocho_desc:0 "Bokut Bilga rules as Iduqut of Qocho, to the south lies the Tibetan Empire that is fragmenting and to the east lies the Guyi Circuit and the Tang Empire and to the west lay various nomadic empires. Bokut rules as a manichean, following the wisdom of the great Prophet Mani, but beyond his court many follow the teachings of the Buddha, others cling to the ancestral tradition of Tengri. \n\n#bold Will you unite the Tarim Basin and strengthen Mani's faithful or will the tides of darkness sweep it all away #!"

  bookmark_sea_tibet_guiyi_desc:0 "Just a decade ago, Zhang Yichao liberated Dunhuang from the rule of the Tibetans, restoring it to the rule of the Tang Empire. Now his Nephew, and chosen successor, Zhang Huaishen is the ruler of the Guyi Circuit. As Tibet fragments, the gateway to China must be safeguarded from outside threats to China. And, of Course, one can not forget about the politics with the Imperial Court, the Tang Dynasty grows weaker day by day, yet it is the emperor that legitimizes one's governorship. \n\n#bold Will Zhang Huaishen hold the eastern gateway or will barbarians sweep across threatening the empire. #!"

  bookmark_sea_tibet_guge_desc:0 "Unlike his supposed brother Yumten, the legitimacy of Ösung's birth is not in question. This may not be enough, however, to maintain control over the western regions of the Tibetan Plateau. Though firmly seated in the kingdom of Guge, the rest of Tibet may soon escape Ösung's grasp.\n\nWill you aid Ösung in taking back his birthright, or is the fragmentation of Tibet all but inevitable?"
  bookmark_sea_tibet_u:0 "Tridé Yumten"
  bookmark_sea_tibet_u_desc:0 "Despite much contention over whether Yumten is truly a legitimate son of Tsenpo Langdarma, he has nonetheless managed to gather support from the lords in the central Ü region of Tibet. His position is, however, precarious at best. The eastern regions long for independence, and it will take skillful maneuvering to avoid utter collapse, let alone the reunification of Tibet.\n\nWill you overcome the odds and bring peace to the plateau? Or has the empire truly come to an end?"
