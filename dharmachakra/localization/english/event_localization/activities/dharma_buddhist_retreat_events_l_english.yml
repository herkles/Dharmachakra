  dharma_buddhist_retreat.001.desc:0 "The journey to the temple was more strenuous than I expected, but we have arrived nonetheless. I engage in the normal formalities upon reaching the temple - prostrating before Lord Buddha, bestowing gifts upon the monks, and so on. Eventually, I remove all my luxurious clothing and put on the humble robes of an ascetic.\n\nAs night comes, I am shown to my dormitory where I will be sleeping during my stay. It's a change from the luxurious palace rooms, but I'll get used to it."

  dharma_buddhist_retreat.004.t:0 "Meditating"
  dharma_buddhist_retreat.004.desc:0 "I'm attempting to meditate with my eyes half-open, as some of the monks have recommended. Still, it's distracting - I'm trying to clear my mind of useless thoughts, yet with my eyes half-open, I can still see some of things happening around me."

  dharma_buddhist_retreat.007.desc:0 "As usual, some of the monks and retreat participants are engaging in spiritual discussion and debate, and I decide to observe. Suddenly, a senior monk of great age brings forth a chair and sets it before everyone.'Can anyone prove that this chair's true essence is that of emptiness, prove that it is an illusion in our mind?' he asks.\n\nThe others eagerly begin making their cases, citing the sutras or referencing ideas about the mindstream and dependent origination, saying the chair is like this and that. However, none of their answers satisfies the old monk. Finally, one monk - who had been silent for some time - speaks up, and asks, 'What chair are we arguing about?''"
  dharma_buddhist_retreat.007.a:0 "I see the old monk smiling"

  dharma_buddhist_retreat.008.t:0 "The Nature of Emptiness"
  dharma_buddhist_retreat.008.desc:0 "I am participating in a philosophical discussion with one of the senior monks to prove how much of the Dharma I've learned. I proclaim, The true nature of everything is emptiness. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not exist. There is no realization, no delusion, no sage. There is no giving and nothing to be received.\n\nThe senior monk is silent, his face unmoving. Is he thinking? Suddenly - WHACK - he hits me on the head. I am angered, but the monk patiently asks me:"

  dharma_buddhist_retreat.010.desc:0 "Sitting still is so difficult! How do these monks manage it? My buttocks are in pain, I am constantly falling asleep... it is so difficult to concentrate while meditating. I could just pretend to be meditating while thinking about other things - that would be much easier, but then that would defeat the purpose of meditation."
  dharma_buddhist_retreat.010.a:0 "I take a deep breath, then redouble my efforts to concentrate."
  dharma_buddhist_retreat.010.b:0 "My mind starts wandering to pleasurable thoughts"

  dharma_buddhist_retreat.011.t:0 "Whack"
  dharma_buddhist_retreat.011.desc:0 "Pleasurable fantasies overtake my mind while I'm supposed to be meditation.

  dharma_buddhist_retreat.013.t:0 "Going Outside"
  dharma_buddhist_retreat.013.desc:0 "I've decided to meditate outside today, rather than inside. Not everyone chooses to meditate this way, preferring the comforts of the inside, but some have said that meditating outside is a very different experience. As I sit down and begin meditating, I can already feel the difference.\n\nNormally, I am so busy with work that I rarely think about what is happening in the world around me. I hear the birds, the insects, the rustling of the trees, the wind as it blows from the heavens above"
