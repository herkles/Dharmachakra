Since coming to power he has dealt with rebellions and succession wars among his vassals. He rules from the great city of Kannauj that so many rivals seek to take.\n\nAnd of his rivals none are greater than the Palas to his east and the Rashtrakutas to the south. The three have long been fighting one another for control over the Gangetic Plain and the city of Kannauj in particular. His armies are ready and prepared should they try to invade.\n\nHowever to the west lies the Islamic Caliphate. While it is currently in a period of crisis as the persians are fighting in the [persian_struggle|E], Mihra Bhoja has fought plenty of battles with the muslim lords.

Some scholars compare him to the great Mauryan King Ashoka. \n\nHowever, he is getting up in age. It will soon become time to ensure a smooth transition of power, to ensure that when he dies, his empire does not die with him. His empire which has brought peace and prosperity to the Deccan could survive him, or it could crumble into infighting. So he has begun to look to ensure that it can survive him. "

Now it is the time for the kingdom of Khotan to rise. \n\nHowever he sits in the middle of a dangerous location. To the south lies Tibet. And should either brother win the succession, they will probably turn their attention towards Khotan to put it back under their control and force tributary payments. To the north lies the great steppe and numerous nomads. Some come for trade, but many more might seek to raid. To the east lay the riches of China, but riches that have faltered and to the west lays the Islamic emirates.\n\nWealth flows through his lands, wealth that he wants to cultivate, and wealth that he will need to defend his kingdom from all the threats around him.

Here perhaps a new home for the Manicheans can begin, a new and greater chapter for the faith. Of course Bokut must not forget that Qocho is a land of many faiths, with many also practicing Buddhism and Tengri. "

Barbarians that the Zhang family has personal experience in fighting. The Tibetan emperor's sons squabble over the throne, but the Zhang's know the Tibetans will return and it is best to be prepared. Then there are the nomads such as the Uyghurs who raid from Qocho and seek to restore their khanate. \n\nBut the Tang are growing weaker and weaker by the day.

 dharma_intro.008.desc: "To the east his half-brother claims that he is not his father's son. That he is a beggar that his mother Nanamsa installed to hold onto power. A lie. A falsehood that he is spreading in order to deny the rightful kingship of Tride Yumten his rightful throne. However a lie that has given his despicable half-brother power, and forced him to seek allies and refuge with his mother's family and the lords of Central Ü. A lie to put distance between him and the fact that his allies the Buddhists were the reason for Langdarma's death.  \n\nWith his supporters, and the allies of his mother's family.

He was forced to abandon it when the imperial army marched across Rama's bridge and recaptured the city. But now he has raised the flag of rebellion. \n\nNow with the war for Lanka in full force, Vijayabahu is looking to the enemies of the Cholas.
