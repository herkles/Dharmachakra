 twelver_imam_event.0002.desc:0 "The great Imam [al_askari.GetFirstName] is dead, leaving behind no heir to claim the Imamate.\n\nOr at least, that what we thought at first. Uthman ibn Sa'id, the man who once represented [al_askari.GetFirstName] and [al_hadi.GetFirstName], has revealed that al-Askari had an infant son named Muhammad, who was proclaimed to be the Mahdi, and was kept hidden from the public in fear of his enemies' persecution.\n\nUthman, along with three other men, have come to represent Muhammad al-Mahdi while he is in his minor ghayba."
