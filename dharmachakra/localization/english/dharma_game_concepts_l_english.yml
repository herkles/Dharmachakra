 game_concept_yazatas_desc:0 "The Yazatas are those who are worthy of worship or veneration in $zoroastrianism_religion$. To some, they are distinct deities; to others, they are emanations of the supreme god.\n\n$zoroastrianism_religion_adj$ [faiths|E] can have different [doctrines|E] representing the set of Yazatas that have been important to them due to reasons of history, culture, geography, and contact with nearby belief systems.\n\nExcept for those whose [faith|E] has the $rice_zoroastrian_no_yazatas_doctrine_name$ [doctrine|E], all $zoroastrianism_religion_adj$ [rulers|E] have access to a [decision|E] to $RICE_khwarezm_worship_yazata$, which gives you a temporary [character_modifier|E] with benefits based on which Yazata you choose. The available Yazatas depends on your Yazata [doctrine|E].\n\nCertain Yazata [doctrines|E] even grant you access to a [decision|E] to Establish a [zoroastrian_cult_center|E], which provide further benefits for worshipping Yazatas."

 game_concept_zoroastrian_cult_center_desc:0 "Some $zoroastrianism_religion_adj$ [faiths|E], if they have the right [yazata|E] [doctrines|E], can take the [decision|E] to $RICE_khwarezm_establish_cult_center$.\n\nCult centers are [counties|E] where worship of a particular [yazata|E] is prominent, and as such, once you choose which [yazata|E] to establish the cult center for, a correpsonding [county_modifier|E] will be placed in your [capital|E]. Afterwards, if you take the [decision|E] to Worship a [yazata|E], and choose a [yazata|E] whose cult center you own (or is owned by your [vassal|E] or someone under them), you'll gain an upgraded version of the [character_modifier|E] you'd usually get, as well as extra [prestige|E] and [piety|E]. Note that there can be only #bold one#! cult center per [duchy|E].\n\nIf your [faith|E] does not have a [doctrine|E] allowing you to make cult centers, or you follow a non-Zoroastrian [faith|E], you can instead take the [decision|E] to $RICE_khwarezm_destroy_cult_center$. Doing so will remove any cult center [county_modifiers|E] in your [domain|E], though if you're Zoroastrian it will only affect those belonging to [yazatas|E] you don't worship. You will also gain [gold|E] and [piety|E] depending on how many cult centers your suppressed."
