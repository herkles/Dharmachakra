# Dharmachakra for CK3

## Latest Version: 1.7.6 "Ananata" (Released 07/11/2025)

This update contains mostly bug fixes that have been reported to me and I have fixed. Further a number of characters have their histories updated to better reflect the actual historical situation. I have also changed the name of Delhi so that prior to Anangpal Tomar founded the city, it goes by a different name and the localization in various innovations now refers to Kannauj as the premier Indian city. Hindus now have the ability to build local monasteries and temples, inspired by the RICE activity for Christians.
