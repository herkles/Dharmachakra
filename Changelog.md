# Dharmachakra for CK3

## Latest Version: 1.7.0 "Hayagriva" (Released 05/09/2025)

This patch updates it for Khans of the steppe. It also includes a new and revised cultural set up. Hopefully the last before All under heaven comes out and I need to revise things again with the rest of asia. I have also added a bookmark for 1066 for the Ghaznavids and their invansion into India.

## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is the WIP version that is constantly being updated!

1. Go to <https://github.com/herkles/Dharmachakra/releases> and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select Dharmachakra in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.

## Usage Notes
Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.
