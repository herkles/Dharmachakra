# Dharmachakra for CK3

## Latest Version: 1.6.0 "Rebirth" (Released 11/08/2024)

After two years Dharmachakra has been revivied. The mod has been updated to the latest update. a lot of the stuff was converted to acitivies instead of decisions. This also meant revamping the holy sites as I no longer needed to have so many for the various pilgrimages. History for south asia has been updated to reflect the decline of Buddhism and in 1178 the decline of Saura. and as 1178 is after Basava established Lingayatism, that faith exists in 1178.I have also added a new bookmark for 1178.

## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is the WIP version that is constantly being updated!

1. Go to <https://github.com/herkles/Dharmachakra/releases> and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select Dharmachakra in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.
